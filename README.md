# phys227-midterm

**Author:** Chinmai Raman

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChinmaiRaman/phys227-midterm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChinmaiRaman/phys227-midterm)

## Specification

Complete the following exercises for your midterm, placing your solutions into ```midterm.py```. Write the solutions as callable functions, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Problem 0
1. Problem 1
1. Problem 2
1. Problem 3
1. Problem 4

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```Midterm.ipynb``` that imports your python file and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

I found the equation sneakily complicated. It was very interesting, and the graph of the bifurcations was very cool. I enjoyed the midterm.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
